## Authentication Practice (repetition is the father of learning).

Authentication/Authorization systems built on Rails. Auth1 is full fledged authorization system utilizing: sessions, remember_me, `has_secure_password`, and Bcrypt gem.

For Oauth I use the omniauth gem to connect allow users to log in via Facebook or Twitter to a toy app.

* Total time to roll Auth1 was 6hrs, I rolled it to see how much I could do without reference; but more importantly to see if I understand the concepts and why things are done the way they are done. I did not leave nearly as many notes via comments as I should have.

* Total time to roll Oauth was 2.5hrs, I referenced Stack Overflow, Omniauth documentation, and RailsApp to fill in gaps in my own Knowledge.
